# randomsg-telegram-bot
A basic telegram bot that tells you bus arrival times

This is an express server hosted on heroku that serves my Telegram Bot -> DamnRandomSGBot. The bot allows users access to a clean way to get nextBus timings by keying in the bus stop number.

Got excited doing this project. Simple, but so much learning. 

Some things I learned:
* getting data from a public API which requires an API key.
* storing the API key securely as env variables in deployment platform (heroku)
* better appreciation of using closures to generate repetitive functions
* dealing with dates in different time zones given that the server is not hosted in my own country. (app is local)
* reading documentation to use APIs effectively
* deploying an express server
* using ngrok during development
* learning is super fun when you are excited about the product you are building.
